              Olive oil has been a staple of Mediterranean cultures for thousands of years, dating back to the Ancient Greeks and Romans, and it remains the most popular cooking oil in the region to this day. In fact, nutrition experts believe the Mediterranean basin is home to some of the longest-living populations precisely because their typical daily diet is so abundant in healthy fats from olive oil.
            </p>
            <p>
              Compared to other cooking oils, olive oil has the unique potential to deliver a one-two punch to chronic and degenerative diseases from the potent polyphenol compounds found in extra virgin olive oil and the high percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) found in all grades. As a result, olive oil consumption has been associated with everything from improved cholesterol levels to better mood to stronger bones.

                  Our group of companies date back the year of 1948. In this year, our Grandfather has founded family's olive oil business by establishing storing and filling facilities. By the time his company has become the largest olive oil vendor in the local market.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, the third generation has made our group of companies export to around forty countries with modern olive oil storage and filling facilities and additional units for the storage and filling of vinegars and sauces and condiments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our companies are still operating in Izmir and Aydin. They are either one of the most important suppliers of the main exporters in the country or one of the exporters with the largest supply potential.
